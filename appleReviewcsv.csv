I don't think there's nothing special about adding more buttons to a smartphone. I don't consider that innovating.
Took two shots of the iPhone 16 Pro Max camera lens. Notice how much darker the lenses are compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max and before?  Apple has applied something to the lens to help prevent lens flare and it really works!!! #Apple #iOS #iPhone16 #iPhone #iPhone16ProMax

„Apple iPhone 16 And iPhone 16 Plus Review: Who Needs Pro?“ — by Forbes #Review #Apple #Pro
"I'll start by saying that I previously owned a pair of original AirPods for several years, and while they served me well, I felt it was time for an upgrade. Enter the AirPods Pro—an extraordinary improvement in every way. The first thing that struck me was the sound quality. It's a massive leap from the original AirPods, offering rich, deep bass that adds a new dimension to my favorite tracks. The highs are beautifully crisp, bringing out details in music that I hadn't noticed before. Another standout feature is the noise cancellation. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or in a crowded café, the AirPods Pro do an impressive job of muting the background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the audio experience. The transparency mode is equally impressive, seamlessly letting in outside sounds when needed without having to remove the earbuds. The fit of the AirPods Pro is another significant upgrade. The customizable ear tips make them much more comfortable for extended wear, and they stay secure even during workouts. I never had that with the original AirPods, which would occasionally slip out. Battery life is solid, and the wireless charging case is a convenient bonus. The overall build quality feels premium, with a sleek design that continues the minimalist aesthetic Apple is known for. In short, the AirPods Pro have exceeded my expectations in every way. They’re a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience, whether you’re upgrading from the original AirPods or new to the Apple ecosystem. Highly recommended."
"First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help! I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine. The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful. The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch. I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low. As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. The AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, descrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes. The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time. Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general. Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!"
"I've owned all versions of airpods, normal, pro, max, etc. My favorite one for the longest time was the Airpod Pros ""version 1"". This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features. *ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC ""level"". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that. *Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that. *Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far. *Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises. *AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well. *Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer ""v3"" ones that are coming out sometime next year. The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells & whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost."
"First time Apple Watch user and I am very happy with the purchase. As a mom of toddler, this is very helpful tool so that I get notification while my phone is inside stroller or diaper bag and chasing my child in the park. I also love the GPS and emergency notification that I can share with my family. I have started to work out little more and care for health as it encourage to stand up, track movement etc which is very helpful. I’m impressed with the battery life and how fast it charges too! I’ve been using iPhone since it came out and MacBook but Apple Watch was something I didn’t think I needed. It’s not something you need, but it is well worth investing to make your life easier. Watch quality and size is perfect for my arm and it is durable and water resistance so I don’t have to worry about it while playing in the splash pad or parks too!"
No scratch and I work a job that’s not exactly gentle with my tech. Easy to use and battery life is great. Quality is perfect and the size is too. Priced well for what you get.
"Does everything it advertises. The watch came brand new, no scratches or anything. Only thing is, the battery life is not the best. However, if you're not using it extensively like tracking workouts every hour, I'm sure you will be fine."
"At first glance this phone seemed fine, but almost immediately I noticed it would randomly loose service, even though everyone else on my plan still had full service. The ear piece speaker doesn’t work, all calls have to be on speaker phone. And the charger that came with it, tried to “this is us” my family."
"The phone looked like a new, just a very minor scratch ,I was amazed by battery life it was 100%,camera and everything works out good I just didn't see if it was locked under one carrier network that's why I returned it back But it was sooo good"
"Spend hours trying to set phone, Amazon support could solve the issue and they gave me the sellers support number which turn out to be Apples support, apple figure the issue was that the phone was on Activation lock which required a long process to de-activate; nothing but negative, negative from from who ever sells these phones."
Way smaller than I could possibly use. I was totally mistreated by a supervisor and he hung up on me. He also refused to credit my account!! I've been working on this all morning and I am going on 3 hours and I get hung up on by a supervisor!!
My son was satisfied with his unlocked renewed iPhone 13 even though he got downgraded since he was not careful enough with his Apple iPhone 14. He said everything works perfectly. He was happy to get such large internal space of 128gb and perfect color RED to brighten up his days daily!!
"iPhone 13, midnight, 256gb, unlocked version, seller = DirectCertified. I ordered 2 for my kids. Both phones were practically same condition. Cosmetic - One phone had a very tiny stress fracture on the screen that measured approx 1"" across. It was only noticeable at direct light and 6"" away. After laying a screen protector, it is not noticeable. Both iphones had 1-2 tiny knicks on the screen. Again, both are only noticeable up front and after laying a screen protector, it is barely noticeable. The casings on both were near flawless. I can tell the previous owners used screen protectors and cases with longevity in mind. I grade both phones a 95% on appearance and like new cosmetically. Battery - One phone had 85% and other had 86%. A bit on the lower end but its all a gamble going the refurbished route. Not bad enough for me to deal with doing an exchange and take a chance I may get a worse condition phone. I suspect its the original batteries in these 2 units. Function - speaker is loud, face ID works, touchscreen is good, sidebar buttons all work, rear and front cameras are clear, everything works as it should. Doesn't seem to have aftermarket parts used on these phones as there is no pop up notification indicating so. I suspect everything on these 2 phones were original. I will update this review after few weeks of use. I am more curious on battery life so we'll see... 8/18/2024 update: kiddos reported the phone battery holds its charge fine. 1 full charge lasts them the whole day. They're using a fast charger purchased off Amazon and so far so good!"
"The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is. Good product, terrible delivery."
"The phone is in a very good condition: No damages, the screen is clean and fine. The battery is 84% which is not good. The phone performs and functions normally, the phone looks good but their is some scratches around the frame of the camera (not on the lens of the camera) doesn't affect the camera. Overall a good deal."
"I was VERY reluctant to buy a phone off Amazon. Being a cellphone professional, I would never recommend it. I took a chance for the price and couldn’t be happier. Upgraded from a IPhone XS to the iPhone 13. I know it’s still out dated but I don’t want to spend an arm and a leg on it and it works for what I need it to. Absolutely no scratches. No cracks. Works perfect. Battery is decent. Small tough wear and tear around camera circles on back. But if that’s the only blemish, great. Thank you for being a honest trustworthy company. The only downside was, it says it included a usb-c to lightening cord. It did not. It came with usb-a to lightening cord. Not a huge problem. I’m glad it came with a charger in general."

Phone was in good condition but flash light did not work. I hope it doesn’t affect the camera flash.
"Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition. If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right. There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case). If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear. However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected. For my use case, the phone met my needs. I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch. I haven't pulled off the screen protector to see if the underlying screen has scratches. if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector. Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case."
"This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied. First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust. The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!"
"at the beginning i was quit disappointed cause the product doe not correspond to the situation ""excellen"". There are many scars and bettery life is just 83%. In fact the condition in my opinion is just ""OK"". however, i was not in the US and not able to return since this one is bought for someone else. It is not possible for me to return it. However, the customer service help me to solve the problem and gave me a good solution about it."
"Currently one week into owning this phone and will update again after a month or so. I ordered the excellent condition version and it came in just that, excellent condition aside from a few dings to the side and one small unnoticeable scratch on the screen and back of the phone. Battery health came at 87% as promised by the excellent condition info in the Amazon renewed/refurbished info area. Which the IPhone 13 will be supported by apple until 2028 so if the battery does get below 80% by then I will just get a replacement battery which isn’t that expensive so this phone is still a great deal. Lastly everything works as it should and I have no complaints right sound is great too."
"So far the phone is working well. Only minor dings on corners, battery only 87% but knew that was a possibility when ordering it. Reason for only 4 stars is it was shipped early and delivered without any advanced notice and sat outside on porch for 1/2 day. I know it was delivery Fed Ex that is responsible for letting know it arrives but would of been watching the day of delivery if would of known."
"I liked it on sight because it was Red! I needed a phone asap, a that’s the one I settled on. I read reviews after reviews, I was skeptical of a refurbished, but price was really the deciding factor. Perfect condition also. As cited."
"I bought the phone in ""excellent"" condition and the phone looks brand new and feels brand new! The issue I have with my phone is the battery. I received a notification that the battery is not an “Apple verified” battery, which I didn’t think was a problem. However, the battery drains really quickly and only lasts about 3 hours. I am also experiencing overheating issues. Like, the phone easily gets hot, but that could also be a battery-related issue. I’m going to get the battery replaced, but otherwise every other aspect of the phone is perfect and working well! Update: In order to get the battery replaced, I had to get the display replaced as well, as it wasn't a genuine apple display. That costed around $400 at the Apple Store. So, in my opinion, it's safer to get the phone straight from apple and spend a bit more money."
"The phone looks terrific and it works fine, but I was surprised that buying ""excellent"" renewed came with an 80% battery minimum - I didn't investigate this in advance so mea culpa - just be aware. I'd have gone with ""good"" or ""acceptable"" if I'd known - it's in an Otterbox case with a glass screen protector anyway, no one sees the case. I do loke the Apple iPhone 13 - the battery life is an improvement over my iPhone 12 Mini - and I didn't want to go with a 14 or 15 as I bought right before the 16 was released so I knew those prices would be dropping - I'll probably upgrade next fall."
"Phone was delivered two days early, which was awesome since i lost my phone and wanted this one as soon as possible. However when it arrived it had a big crack across the top of it on the back side. The sides on the back have dirt in them and in some spots it looks like the back panel is chipped and clearly has been dropped. The package did not have any cushioning, it was in a big box with just a plastic bag around the phone. Other than that I am very happy with this, however I would not have classified this phone as being in excellent condition."
"The phone is in good condition, no scratches or anything but it does overheats quickly , when I first received the phone the battery life was at 84 % not even one week of usage it went down to 81 % which is very disappointing . The screen is good in general and overall it’s a good phone for the price but if you like a higher quality I’d say buy it at apple ."
For excellent condition I expected a good screen and better battery health but other than the permanent black spot on the screen and 88% battery everything seems to be working properly
Overall it is an update however an important aspect like bluetooth is pretty essential and does not seem to work on this phone
